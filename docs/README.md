# Met ECS post-mortem

## Introdution

When I started to work on **Met ECS**, I had [one project](https://github.com/guillaume-haerinck/imac-tower-defense) dealing with Entity Component Systems on my back. At the time I used the [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) library by Skypjack to structure my application. As the most popular Open-Source library currently available, it seemed like a great starting point to structure my library and test its performance afterwards.

Through these lines, I will do my best to explain what is ECS, what it stands for and how I implemented this paradigm following the ENTT library API. The code is not the most performant there is, but it is short, and tries to be easy to understand.

If you spot a mistake, or have any comment, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/guillaume-haerinck/met-ecs/issues) on this repository.

## I - Why ECS ?
> An explanation of data-oriented practices, their history, advantages and uses in the real world

There are multiple good reason to use an ECS architecture if you are building a game, or even an application. As any other paradigm, it has it own drawbacks and is **not suited for every need**. To know if it's made for you, you need to *"know your data"*. Where, how, by whom and at which frequency it will be modified. 

Many aspects will be detailled below, and you will find a summary table at the end of this part.

### Performance

#### Data locality

Cache misses. You might have never heard of this term but it is nowadays one of the barebones of your application execution speed. While the calcuation speed of our processors kept getting faster and faster - following [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) - the data access time didn't keep up.

> Sure, we can _process_ data faster than ever, but we canâ€™t _get_ that data faster. Bob Nystrom

When the CPU has to read data from the RAM, it takes a lot of time. To prevent this from happening a lot, CPU vendors created **small local memory caches** inside of CPUs. Given their sizes and positions, they are way faster than RAM access. We name these caches by their levels, L1, L2, L3, etc. The smaller is the number, the smaller is the size but faster is the read access.

#### Data oriented design

> When there is one, there is many. XXX

- Performances gain with less cache miss and think about the bulk
- History of data oriented design and the emergence of ecs

### Maintenability
- Maintenability with separation of data and logic
- Inheritence problems with oop, or performance

### Portability
- Reuse systems accross projets
- Greets the fact that from one app to another easier to understand the structure with ECS

### Adoption in the industry
- Usage in the industry and the future
- Warn about getting used to it and problems to reason about static data and unity

## II - The theory
> Discover what are entities, component and systems. Understand how they interact together 

- Explain what are components entities and systems
- Give tangible examples of interaction for a specific behavior
- Talk about maintenability and easy to add features
- Difficult to start with and sometimes to prototype as difficult to reason for one entity

## III - Interacting with ECS
> What are the possible APIs available to use ECS and what are their advantages

- Registering components vs declaring them in advance
- Registrering systems or not
- Using a central registry
- Examples in the industry
- The API of met ecs

## IV - Data structure
> How the data of ECS is stored and accessed

- Pure array
- Sparse set
- Archetypes
- The sparse set of met ecs
- The view creation of met ecs
- The templates tips and tricks

## V - The case of static data
> What are the ways to handle the global states of your app like inputs or graphic objects

- Singleton components (outside or inside ECS)
- Event system
- Parse files
- Handle things outside of ECS is common
