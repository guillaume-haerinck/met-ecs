# Met ECS

A simple [Entity Component System](#what-is-ecs-) library made for learning purposes. It is **header-only**, so just have to copy the content of the `src` folder and include `<met/met.hpp>` to check it out. It does require a C++ 17 version of your compiler though.

---

Made by students, the project purposes are to be easy to understand and thoroughly documented. It is seen as an **entry point for users and developers**. We provide both a [post-mortem](docs/README.md) to explain the inner-working of the library, and many [exercices](learn/README.md) to get started with ECS.

The API is heavly based on [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) by skypjack, you should check it out if you're looking for a highly performant and production-ready library.

## Introduction

### What is ECS ?

ECS (Entity Component System) is way to organize your data and your logic which radicaly changes from traditional Object-Oriented Programming. It is seen as both a way to improve performance and to ease maintenance. Well-suited for games, it is designed to handle operations on large groups.

ECS is made out of 3 pieces that can be summarized with these simple rules :

- Entities are unique identifiers
- Components are plain datatypes (Positions, Colors, etc...)
- Entities can possess zero or more components
- Systems are logic executed on entities with matching component sets

### Code Example

```C++
#include <met/met.hpp>

struct Position {
    float x;
    float y;
};

struct Velocity {
    float dx;
    float dy;
};

int main() {
    met::registry registry;
    auto entity = registry.create();
    
    Position pos = { 2, 3 };
    registry.assign<position>(entity, pos);
    
    Velocity vel = { 5, 8 };
    registry.assign<position>(entity, vel);
    
    registry.view<Position, Velocity>().each([](met::entity id, Position& pos, Velocity& vel) {
        pos.x += 2;
        std::cout << "pos " << pos.x << " " << pos.y << std::endl;
        std::cout << "vel " << vel.dx << " " << vel.dy << std::endl;
    });

    // ...
}
```

## Learn

### Use an ECS library

Some [exercices](learn/README.md) has been created to use ECS step by step.

### Create an ECS library

The [post-mortem](docs/README.md) offers a view on ECS possible implementations and explain everything there is to know about this library.

## Build unit tests

### Prerequisites

You need to have CMake and a C++ compiler which handles C++ 17.

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

#### Windows

You can install Visual Studio to get the MSVC compiler, and you can download CMake from their website.
